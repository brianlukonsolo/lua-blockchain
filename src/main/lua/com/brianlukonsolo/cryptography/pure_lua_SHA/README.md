# pure_lua_SHA

SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3 and BLAKE2 functions written in pure Lua and optimized for speed.

---
### Installation

Just copy `sha2.lua` to Lua modules' folder.

### Description

This module provides functions to calculate SHA digest.  
This is a pure-Lua module, compatible with **Lua 5.1**, **Lua 5.2**, **Lua 5.3**, **Lua 5.4**, **LuaJIT 2.0/2.1** and **Fengari**.

Main feature of this module: it was heavily optimized for speed.  
For every Lua version the module contains particular implementation branch to get benefits from version-specific features.

Supported hashes:
```lua

-- BLAKE2s synonyms for shortened digest:
BLAKE2s-128    - sha.blake2s_128(message, key, salt)  -- BLAKE2s with digest_size_in_bytes = 16
BLAKE2s-160    - sha.blake2s_160(message, key, salt)  -- BLAKE2s with digest_size_in_bytes = 20
BLAKE2s-224    - sha.blake2s_224(message, key, salt)  -- BLAKE2s with digest_size_in_bytes = 28

```
---
### Usage

Input data should be provided as a binary string: either as a whole string or as a sequence of substrings ("chunk-by-chunk" loading).  
Result (SHA digest) is returned in hexadecimal representation (as a string of lowercase hex digits).  

Simplest usage example:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local your_hash = sha.sha256("your string")
-- assert(your_hash == "d14d691dac70eada14d9f23ef80091bca1c75cf77cf1cd5cf2d04180ca0d9911")
```
See file "sha2_test.lua" for more examples.

### FAQ
---
#### :large_blue_circle: Does this module calculate SHA really fast?
Probably, this is the fastest pure Lua implementation of SHA you can find.  
For example, on x64 Lua 5.3 this module calculates SHA256 twice as fast as the implementation published at [lua-users.org](http://lua-users.org/wiki/SecureHashAlgorithmBw)  
This module has best performance on every Lua version because it contains several version-specific implementation branches:  
   - branch for **Lua 5.1** (emulating bitwise operators using look-up table)
   - branch for **Lua 5.2** (using **bit32** library), suitable also for **Lua 5.1** with external **bit** library
   - branch for **Lua 5.3 / 5.4** (using native **64**-bit bitwise operators)
   - branch for **Lua 5.3 / 5.4** (using native **32**-bit bitwise operators) for Lua built with `LUA_INT_TYPE=LUA_INT_INT`
   - branch for **LuaJIT without FFI library** (if you're working in a sandboxed environment with FFI disabled)
   - branch for **LuaJIT x86 without FFI library** (LuaJIT x86 has oddity because of lack of x86 CPU registers)
   - branch for **LuaJIT 2.0 with FFI library** (`bit.*` functions work only with 32-bit values)
   - branch for **LuaJIT 2.1 with FFI library** (`bit.*` functions can work with `int64_t` cdata)
---
#### :large_blue_circle: How to get SHA digest as binary string instead of hexadecimal representation?
Use function `sha.hex_to_bin()` to convert hexadecimal to binary:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local binary_hash = sha.hex_to_bin(sha.sha256("your string"))
-- assert(binary_hash == "\209Mi\29\172p\234\218\20\217\242>\248\0\145\188\161\199\\\247|\241\205\\\242\208A\128\202\r\153\17")
```
---
#### :large_blue_circle: How to get SHA digest as base64 string?
There are functions `sha.bin_to_base64()` and `sha.base64_to_bin()` for converting between binary and base64:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local binary_hash = sha.hex_to_bin(sha.sha256("your string"))
local base64_hash = sha.bin_to_base64(binary_hash)
-- assert(base64_hash == "0U1pHaxw6toU2fI++ACRvKHHXPd88c1c8tBBgMoNmRE=")
```
---
#### :large_blue_circle: How to calculate SHA digest of long data stream?
It is not necessary to prepare the whole data stream as single Lua string.  
All hash functions implemented in this module switch to "chunk-by-chunk" input mode when `message` parameter is `nil`:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local append = sha.sha256()  -- if the "message" argument is omitted then "append" function is returned
append("your")
append(" st")                -- you should pass all parts of your long message to the "append" function (chunk-by-chunk)
append("ring")
local your_hash = append()   -- and finally ask for the result (by invoking the "append" function without argument)
-- assert(your_hash == "d14d691dac70eada14d9f23ef80091bca1c75cf77cf1cd5cf2d04180ca0d9911")
```
---
#### :large_blue_circle: Is it possible to calculate multiple hash digests of the same file by reading the file only once?
Yes.  
Each calculation instance uses its own private variables, so you can run multiple calculations in parallel:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local append1 = sha.sha256()  -- create calculation instance #1
local append2 = sha.sha512()  -- create calculation instance #2
local file = io.open("path/to/your/file", "rb")
for message_part in function() return file:read(4096) end do  -- "file:lines(4096)" is shorter but incompatible with Lua 5.1
   append1(message_part)
   append2(message_part)
end
file:close()
local file_sha256 = append1()
local file_sha512 = append2()
```
---
#### :large_blue_circle: How to calculate HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256, etc. ?
The `key` parameter of HMAC function is a binary string of any length.
```lua
-- Calculating HMAC-SHA1
local sha = require("sha2")
local your_hmac = sha.hmac(sha.sha1, "your key", "your message")
-- assert(your_hmac == "317d0dfd868a5c06c9444ac1328aa3e2bfd29fb2")
```
The same in "chunk-by-chunk" input mode (for long messages):
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local append = sha.hmac(sha.sha1, "your key")
append("your")
append(" message")
local your_hmac = append()
-- assert(your_hmac == "317d0dfd868a5c06c9444ac1328aa3e2bfd29fb2")
```
---
#### :large_blue_circle: How to calculate MAC based on BLAKE2?
BLAKE2 supports keying out-of-the-box, additional function like HMAC is not required for BLAKE2 functions.  
The `key` parameter in BLAKE2 functions is a binary string, its length is limited by:
- 64 bytes for BLAKE2b/BLAKE2bp/BLAKE2Xb
- 32 bytes for BLAKE2s/BLAKE2sp/BLAKE2Xs

If the `key` parameter set to empty string, BLAKE2 function is calculated key-less (as if `key` parameter was omitted).
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local your_mac = sha.blake2b("your message", "your key")
-- assert(your_mac == "feee3e3aac7d5a3a4653fb70667ad6fb5fafe5256c78867b421eb0ce4134fc62784002b261056c4ef4222e99a8944826dff6f4845ac0117df128de116b159d75")
```
The same in "chunk-by-chunk" input mode (for long messages):
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local append = sha.blake2b(nil, "your key")
append("your")
append(" message")
local your_mac = append()
-- assert(your_mac == "feee3e3aac7d5a3a4653fb70667ad6fb5fafe5256c78867b421eb0ce4134fc62784002b261056c4ef4222e99a8944826dff6f4845ac0117df128de116b159d75")
```

#### :large_blue_circle: Can SHAKE128 / SHAKE256 be used to generate digest of infinite length?
Yes!  
For example, you can convert your password into infinite stream of pseudo-random bytes.  
Set `digest_size_in_bytes` to magic value `-1` and obtain the function `get_next_part(part_size_in_bytes)`.  
Invoke this function repeatedly to get consecutive parts of the infinite digest.
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local get_next_part_of_digest = sha.shake128(-1, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "f4202e3c58") -- 5 bytes in hexadecimal representation
assert(get_next_part_of_digest()  == "52")         -- size=1 is assumed when omitted
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(0) == "")           -- size=0 is a valid size
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(4) == "f9182a04")   -- and so on to the infinity...
-- Note: you can use sha.hex_to_bin() to convert these hexadecimal parts to binary strings
-- By definition, the result of SHAKE with finite "digest_size_in_bytes" is just a finite prefix of "infinite digest":
assert(sha.shake128(4, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")) == "f4202e3c")
```
It's possible to combine "chunk-by-chunk" input mode with "chunk-by-chunk" output mode:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local append_input_message = sha.shake128(-1)
append_input_message("The quick brown fox")
append_input_message(" jumps over the lazy dog")
local get_next_part_of_digest = append_input_message()  -- input stream is terminated, now we can start receiving the output stream
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "f4202e3c58")
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "52f9182a04")      -- and so on...
```
Please note that you can not get the bytes at some arbitrary position of the SHAKE digest without calculating all previous bytes.

---
#### :large_blue_circle: Why does each BLAKE2 function have `digest_size_in_bytes` parameter?
For SHA2 family of hash functions, if you want to get a shorter digest, you calculate the full-size digest and truncate it to the size you want.  
For BLAKE2 family of hash functions, the situation is different.  
By default the digest size is:  
   - 64 for BLAKE2b and BLAKE2bp (512 bits)
   - 32 for BLAKE2s and BLAKE2sp (256 bits)

If you need a shorter digest, specify the size in `digest_size_in_bytes` parameter.  
Please note that the shorter result will NOT match the prefix of the full-length digest for the same message.  
This happens because in BLAKE2 family of hash functions different `digest_size_in_bytes` values produce different hash functions. 

If you need a longer digest, use BLAKE2Xb or BLAKE2Xs to produce digest of arbitrary size.

---
#### :large_blue_circle: How to use BLAKE2X functions?
X means XOF = "extensible output function".  
Internally BLAKE2Xb/BLAKE2Xs invokes its inner function (BLAKE2b for BLAKE2Xb, BLAKE2s for BLAKE2Xs) to get fixed size hash, and then extends the hash to arbitrary size.  
The full name of a BLAKE2X function includes the digest length in bytes, for example, BLAKE2Xs132 produces 1056-bit digests.  
Usage example:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
-- calculate BLAKE2Xb16MiB and get the result as huge Lua string
local your_hash = sha.blake2xb(16 * 2^20, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
-- assert(#your_hash == 32 * 2^20 and your_hash:match"^53e2dcdfe2.*b2b5312606$")
```
Sometimes you might want to avoid creating very long Lua strings.  
Negative values of `digest_size_in_bytes` mean you want to receive the result in "chunk-by-chunk" output mode:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
-- calculate BLAKE2Xb16MiB and get the result in "chunk-by-chunk" output mode
local get_next_part_of_digest = sha.blake2xb(-16 * 2^20, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "53e2dcdfe2") -- 5 bytes in hexadecimal representation
assert(get_next_part_of_digest()  == "1b")         -- size=1 is assumed when omitted
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(0) == "")           -- size=0 is a valid size
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(3) == "21af5b")     -- next 3 bytes
get_next_part_of_digest(16 * 2^20 - 14)            -- read all the remaining bytes of 16MiB hash except last 5
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "b2b5312606") -- last 5 bytes of 16MiB
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(1) == "")           -- after all parts of the digest are received, empty strings are returned
```
It's possible to combine "chunk-by-chunk" input mode with "chunk-by-chunk" output mode:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
-- calculate BLAKE2Xb16MiB: pass message in "chunk-by-chunk" input mode and get the result in "chunk-by-chunk" output mode
local append_input_message = sha.blake2xb(-16 * 2^20)
append_input_message("The quick brown fox")
append_input_message(" jumps over the lazy dog")
local get_next_part_of_digest = append_input_message()  -- input stream is terminated, now we can start receiving the output stream
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(4) == "53e2dcdf")
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(4) == "e21b21af")        -- and so on...
```
Sometimes you don't know the digest size in advance.  
You can set `digest_size_in_bytes` to magic value `-1` to generate infinite digest.  
Please note that BLAKE2X digest of finite size will NOT match the prefix of the infinite digest for the same message.
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
-- calculate BLAKE2XbInf (infinite digest)
local get_next_part_of_digest = sha.blake2xb(-1, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "364e84ca4c")
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "103df29230")      -- and so on to the infinity...
```
When generating BLAKE2X digest (finite or infinite) in "chunk-by-chunk" output mode, you can immediately jump to arbitrary position of the digest:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
-- calculate BLAKE2XbInf (infinite digest)
local get_next_part_of_digest = sha.blake2xb(-1, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "364e84ca4c")
get_next_part_of_digest("seek", 10*2^30)  -- jump to position 10GiB of the digest without calculating all previous bytes
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "eeafce070f")
get_next_part_of_digest("seek", 0)        -- jump to the beginning of the digest
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "364e84ca4c")
get_next_part_of_digest("seek", 1)        -- jump to the second byte of the digest
assert(get_next_part_of_digest(5) == "4e84ca4c10")
```
---
#### :large_blue_circle: Is the SHAKE / BLAKE2X "infinite digest" obtained by `digest_size_in_bytes = -1` really infinite ?
For SHAKE functions, the "infinite digest" is really infinite.  
You can NOT fast forward to arbitrary position without calculating all previous bytes of the digest.

For BLAKE2X functions, the "infinite digest" is NOT infinite - it is periodic with a large period (256GiB for BLAKE2Xb and 128GiB for BLAKE2Xs).  
The period size equals to 2^32 times inner function digest size.  
For example, digest size of BLAKE2b is 64 bytes, so the period of BLAKE2Xb is `64*2^32 = 256*2^30` bytes.  
You can fast forward to arbitrary position.  
Please note that `get_next_part_of_digest("seek", 256*2^30)` is equivalent to `get_next_part_of_digest("seek", 0)` due to periodicity.

---
#### :large_blue_circle: What is the `salt` parameter in all BLAKE2 functions?
`salt` is a binary string, different `salt` values generate different hash functions.  
By default empty string is used as a `salt`.

`salt` is useful when you need to create multiple hash functions which don't collide with each other.  
Let's imagine you want to have 10 different hash functions similar to SHA-256.  
You can define them as salted BLAKE2:
```lua
for i = 1, 10 do
   local salt = "salt"..i
   H[i] = function (message, key)
      return sha.blake2b_256(message, key, salt)
   end
end
```
Collisions are practically impossible: if `i1 ~= i2` then `H[i1](message1) ~= H[i2](message2)`.  
In other words, you can safely store hash values of all 10 functions as keys inside a common table.

To implement salt for other hash functions (like SHA-256) you usually have to append salt string to a message, but BLAKE2 implements salt more efficiently.

According to the BLAKE2 documentation, "Salt" field length is limited by:
- 16 bytes for BLAKE2b/BLAKE2bp/BLAKE2Xb
- 8 bytes for BLAKE2s/BLAKE2sp/BLAKE2Xs

If `salt` parameter is shorter, it is right-padded with zero bytes and stored in "Salt" field of the BLAKE2 Parameter Block.  
If `salt` parameter is longer, this implementation does not raise an error, instead it sends extra bytes to "Personalization" field.  
"Personalization" is actually "just another salt" field in BLAKE2 Parameter Block, "Personalization" field has the same length as "Salt" field.  
In other words, BLAKE2 functions implemented in this module expect `salt` parameter to hold a concatenation of "Salt"+"Personalization" fields, so maximal length of `salt` parameter is limited by:
- 32 bytes for BLAKE2b/BLAKE2bp/BLAKE2Xb
- 16 bytes for BLAKE2s/BLAKE2sp/BLAKE2Xs

---
#### :large_blue_circle: There are two methods of BLAKE2 hash function customization: adding `key` and adding `salt`.  What is the difference?

Processing the `key` is significantly more expensive (in terms of CPU load) than processing the `salt`.  
Adding `key` is equivalent to prepending a whole block of data (128 bytes for BLAKE2b, 64 bytes for BLAKE2s) to the message, hashing this additional block is a lot of extra CPU work.  
Adding `salt` is equivalent to modifying initialization vectors with the salt string, this is just a few XOR operations.  
Usually `key` is used for secret strings and `salt` for non-secret strings.  
One might guess that `key` is somehow more securely protected than `salt`, but actually `salt` can also store secret strings (very similar hash function BLAKE3 processes its `key` exactly the same way as `salt` is processed in BLAKE2).

---
#### :large_blue_circle: I need a secure hash function in my Lua script.  Which one is the fastest?
MD5 is not secure, so six competitors remain: SHA-1, SHA-256, BLAKE2s, SHA-512, SHA3-256, BLAKE2b.  
(The first three internally use 32-bit words, the last three - 64-bit words.)  
If these hash functions implemented in C, the fastest one will be BLAKE2, because BLAKE2 benefits from SIMD instructions in modern CPUs.  
But in Lua we can not tell the compiler to use SIMD instructions, so the winner is different.

| Lua version               | The fastest        | 2nd                 | 3rd                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Lua 5.1                   | SHA1  (0.4 MB/s)   | BLAKE2s  (0.4 MB/s) | BLAKE2b  (0.3 MB/s) |
| Lua 5.2                   | SHA1  (2.9 MB/s)   | BLAKE2s  (2.4 MB/s) | BLAKE2b  (1.6 MB/s) |
| Lua 5.4                   | BLAKE2b  (18 MB/s) | BLAKE2s  (9.5 MB/s) | SHA1  (8.7 MB/s)    |
| LuaJIT sandboxed (no FFI) | SHA1  (180 MB/s)   | SHA256  (140 MB/s)  | BLAKE2s  (100 MB/s) |
| LuaJIT 2.0 + FFI          | SHA1  (330 MB/s)   | SHA256  (190 MB/s)  | BLAKE2s  (160 MB/s) |
| LuaJIT 2.1 + FFI          | SHA1  (330 MB/s)   | SHA512  (200 MB/s)  | SHA256  (190 MB/s)  |

#### :large_blue_circle: I need a hash function for hashing user passwords.  Which one should I use?
Strictly speaking, you should NOT use a general-purpose hash functions for hashing passwords in a serious application, instead you should use Argon2 or the like.  
But probably your Lua script does not have a lot of RAM for a good password hashing algorithm.  
So, as a workaround, you can calculate salted BLAKE2 10000 times:
```lua
local sha = require("sha2")
local function hash_user_password(user_id, user_name, user_password)
   local user_salt = (tostring(user_id)..user_name):sub(1, 16)
   local hash = user_password
   local f = sha.blake2s
   for i = 1, 10000 do
      hash = f(hash, nil, user_salt)
   end
   return hash  -- string of 64 hex digits
end
```
---
#### :large_blue_circle: Why does this module called "sha2.lua" despite of having implemented all SHA functions (SHA1, SHA2, SHA3) and BLAKE2?
The first release of this module contained only SHA2 functions, hence the name `sha2.lua`.  
But I can't rename the module due to backward-compatibility I've promised to keep forever (Was it a silly promise?)

---
### Backward-compatibility
This module will always keep backward-compatibility.  
If your program works successfully with some previous version of `sha2.lua`, it will also work with the latest version.
